Source Code for Tucker Carlson (Bot) AKA VC Helper (Beta). Currently in beta development!

Bot is designed for the Virtual Congress Discord server. You may copy or use any part of this code in your project, but please provide me credit. 

Feel free to make PRs if there are issues!

NOTE: embeddings.py is extremely computationally intensive. Either run it on a Colab notebook or replace "gemma3:27B" with a smaller model and change the chat template. Recommended at least 48GB VRAM (2x NVIDIA RTX 3090 or better). Requires 4-8 hours of GPU time to run depending on corpus size.
